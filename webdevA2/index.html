                    <p> Ever wondered what makes the "ooh-woo" bird calls in the morning?
                        It comes from the Asian koel, which is a large cuckoo bird. Its loud
                        call is made by male birds in order to attract female birds to mate.
                        </p>

                    <h3>How does it look like?</h3>
                    <p>The male Asian koel is glossy bluish-black, with a pale greenish grey bill, 
                        the iris is crimson, and it has grey legs and feet. The female is brownish 
                        on the crown and has rufous streaks on the head. The back, rump, and wing 
                        coverts are dark brown with white and buff spots. The underparts are whitish 
                        but are heavily striped. The upper plumage of young birds is more like that
                        of the male and they have a black beak.</p>

                            Its eggs would hatch about 3 days ahead of the hosts chicks, but does not always
                            push out the other eggs or evict the host chicks. The hosts will care for the young Koel, which will
